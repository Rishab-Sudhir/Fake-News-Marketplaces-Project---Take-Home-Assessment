## Setup

### The set up is the same as instructed in the instruction doc, here it is below for reference: 

I did all of this in a virtual environment to make things easier

**1)** Node.js - this is the language the application is written in and that you will be developing the extended experiments in: Install Node.js and npm using Homebrew on OS X
       **'brew install npm'** works for me since I have installed the Homebrew package manager for mac.
       If you donâ€™t want to use Homebrew then there are other ways to install node.js through the Anaconda package manager, if you have used this in the past.
       
**2)** Install Empirica following the instructions in Setup - [Empirica v2 Docs](https://docs.empirica.ly/getting-started/setup)
       REMEMBER: you need to **`cd client && npm install`** and **`cd server && npm install`** in order to install the packages in the `package.json` file in both the client/ and server/   
       directories.
